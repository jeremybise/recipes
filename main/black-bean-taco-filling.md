# Black Bean Taco Filling

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cups cooked or canned black beans, drained
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- Black pepper to taste

## Directions

Heat the oven to 400°F. Coat a rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Stack the tortillas and wrap them in aluminum foil. Combine the beans, garlic, chili powder, cumin, half of the salt, and some pepper in a bowl. Mash the mixture with a fork or potato masher; it should still be chunky.

Spread the mixture out on the prepared pan, drizzle with another tablespoon of oil, and roast, stirring a few times, until the beans are crumbly and crisp in places, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the tortillas to the oven with the beans for their last 5 minutes of cooking.
