# White Bread with 80% Biga

## Notes

- Suitable for pizza and focaccia
- **Biga fermentation** 12 to 14 hours
- **Bulk fermentation** 2.5 to 3 hours
- **Proof time** 1 hour
- **Sample schedule:** Mix the biga at 6pm, mix the final dough at 8am the next morning, shape into loaves at 11am and bake at about noon.

## Ingredients

### Biga

- 800g white flour
- 544 water (80 degrees F)
- 0.64g instant dried yeast

### Final Dough

- 200g white flour
- 206g water (105 degrees F)
- 22g fine sea salt
- 2g instant dried yeast
- Biga, all from above

## Directions

1. **Mix the biga.** The evening before baking, put 800g white flour in a large tub. Put 544g 80 degrees F water in a separate container. Put 0.64g yeast in a small container. Add about 3tbsp of the water to the yeast and combine. Let the yeast mixture rest a few minutes before mixing with your finger and dumping into the flour. Add another couple tbsp of water to the yeast container and swirl, then dump into the flour with the remaining warm water. Mix by hand, using the pincer method, alternating with folding until incorporated. Let the biga mature 12-14 hours. It should be slightly domed, tripled in volume, pocked with gas bubbles and smell strongly of alcohol.
2. **Mix the final dough.** Measure 200g flour into large tub, add the 22g of salt and 2g of yeast and mix by hand. Pour in 206g of 105 degree F water and mix by hand just until incorporated. Add the biga. Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing. It's fine to wet your hand three of four times during hte mixing process. Use the pincer method, alternating with folding to fully incorporate the ingredients. Bulk fermentation will take 2.5 to 3 hours.
3. **Fold.** This dough needs two or three folds within the first 1.5 hours after mixing. Whent he doug is about triple its original volume, 2.5 to 3 hours after mixing, it's ready to divide.
4. **Divide.**
5. **Shape.**
